#Intro Python Assignments

##Student Questionnaire
*Your Task*: You are designing a program that will be used to get to know different students at Amphi. To do this, the program should ask the student for:
- [x] Their name
- [x] Their age
- [x] Their favorite safari animal
- [x] Choose 3 more questions of your own you'd like to ask
Once you have all of this information, you should address them by their name and tell them a positive message
For example: "Hi Kevin! Hope you have a great day!"
*Watch Out For*:
- [x] Watch your quotes around your strings
- [x] If you want to combine several strings, remember to use plus signs between them
*File to Edit*: student.py

##Simple Calculator

*Your Task*: Create a calculator that asks the user for 2 numbers, then shows the result after:
- [x] Adding the two numbers
- [x] Subtracting the two numbers
- [x] Multiplying the two numbers
- [x] Dividing the two numbers
- [x] Taking the first number to the power of the second number (Ex: 2, 5 -> 32)
- [x] Finding the remainder after the first number is divided by the second number (Ex: 9, 4 -> 1)
Your program should print all of these answers on separate lines
*Watch Out For*:
- [x] Be careful about converting between strings and ints
- [x] If you forgot how to do exponents and remainders, look at the notes for this assignment
