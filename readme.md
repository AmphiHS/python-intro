# Intro Python Assignments

You can complete the assignments below in any order. You must complete <b>3 out of the 4</b> programs to earn full credit.

## Student Questionnaire

<b>Your Task</b>: You are designing a program that will be used to get to know different students at Amphi. To do this, the program should ask the student for:

-  Their name
-  Their age
-  Their favorite safari animal
-  Choose 3 more questions of your own you'd like to ask

Once you have all of this information, you should address them by their name and tell them a positive message
For example: "Hi Kevin! Hope you have a great day!"

<b>Watch Out For</b>:

-  Watch your quotes around your strings
-  If you want to combine several strings, remember to use plus signs between them

## Simple Calculator

<b>Your Task</b>: We are beginning the process of designing a calculator. Right now, it's going to be pretty simple - just doing basic operations. But later, as we learn more things, we'll make this calculator more useful and complex. For now, just create a calculator that asks the user for 2 numbers, then shows the result after:

-  Adding the two numbers
-  Subtracting the two numbers
-  Multiplying the two numbers
-  Dividing the two numbers
-  Taking the first number to the power of the second number (Ex: 2, 5 -> 32)
-  Finding the remainder after the first number is divided by the second number (Ex: 9, 4 -> 1)

For now, your program should print all of these answers on separate lines

<b>Watch Out For</b>:

-  Be careful about converting between strings and ints
-  If you forgot how to do exponents and remainders, look at the notes for this assignment

## Create a Mad Lab

<b>Your Task</b>: You're going to create a Mad-Lib for the user to fill in. A Mad-Lib is like a story with some of the important information removed - for example, the character's name and location is something the user can fill in.

To create this mad-lib, you should first come up with your story. Try writing it in a google doc or on a sheet of paper. The only story requirement is it *must end with an explosion*.

Once you have a story, find places that the user can replace with their own suggestion. You'll need to make room for:

-  6 nouns
-  3 verbs
-  2 adjectives
-  2 adverbs
-  a location
-  a color

Once the user has entered all of their words, print out your story *on one line*.

<b>Watch Out For</b>:

-  Watch your syntax when you're _concatenating_ strings together
